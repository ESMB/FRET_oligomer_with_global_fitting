Single-molecule confocal microscopy analysis of labelled protein aggregates, 
detected by FRET. Calculates size and FRET efficiency of each aggregate, 
generates 2D contour plots, and fits the FRET histograms to Gaussian 
distributions. 

1) FRET_confocal_size.py

Run this code to threshold and select events. Generates histograms and 
output data to be used for other code. 

2) 2D_Plots.ipf

Igor Pro code to generate publication-quality 2D contour plots of size and 
FRET efficiency. 

3) 1Gaussian_global.py

Globally fits histograms to Guassian distribution. 

4) 2Gaussian_global.py

Globally fits histograms to 2 Gaussian distributions.
